# PositiveQuotes
This application is an android application to help people from around the world to feel more optimistically about their life by showing them the full half of the water glass and force them to remember their happy moments by continuously notifying them based on their favorite interval.

For this reason I named this app "Quokkaism". It's made after the name of the happiest animal in the world "Quokka". Personally every moment that I see that funny face, it makes me happy for some moments and nothing is greater and more important than happiness during the whole life.

I hope you enjoy form this idea and feel free to communicate with me if you had any thing to share with me, any feedback, any idea to make it better and etc, by sending email to me : [meysam.shohrat@gmail.com][mail]

# Note
There is another project on my github profile which is the Backend server application for this app, because this app gets all of the information about the quotes from an online server and manages when to show them based on the user preferences. If you are interested, you can visit it from [here][profile].
